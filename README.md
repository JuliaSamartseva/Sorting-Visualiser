# Graph Visualisation

Graph visualisation allows you to see how the array with the certain length is sorted by using different algorithms (Quick sort, Merge sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort, Cocktail sort)

## OOP patterns used
* **MVC pattern**

Using model, view, controller to enter and display orders from the user interface.

* **Strategy pattern**

Using strategy pattern to represent different sorting algorithms and work with them effectively.

* **Observer pattern**

Using signal-slot mechanism in QT as an observer pattern to track changes in the array during the process of sorting to update the UI.

* **Singletone pattern**

Coming soon
